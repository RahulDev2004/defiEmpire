Welcome to the DeFi Kingdom Clone project! This repository contains the smart contracts that i have used to build this project.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your DeFi Kingdom clone:

### Step 1: Set Up Your EVM Subnet

Follow the provided guide and Avalanche documentation to create a custom EVM subnet on the Avalanche network.

### Step 2: Define Your Native Currency

Set up your native currency, which will act as the in-game currency for your DeFi Kingdom clone.

### Step 3: Connect to Metamask

Connect your EVM subnet to Metamask by following the steps outlined in our guide.

### Step 4: Deploy Basic Building Blocks

Use Solidity and Remix to deploy the following smart contracts:

- **Token Contract (`token.sol`):** Manages the creation and functionality of your native currency token.
- **Vault Contract (`vault.sol`):** Establishes a secure vault for storing and managing users' assets.
- **Land Contract (`land.sol`):** Defines the rules for land ownership within your DeFi Kingdom clone.
